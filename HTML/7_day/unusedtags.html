        <p>By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, 
            it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view.
            But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, 
            bats right-handed in the top order across formats,  and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.
            But he elevated himself into the global pantheon of greats at the 2019 World Cup, 
            where he was not only named player of the tournament but he carried himself with unprecedented 
            class as the trophy was snatched from New Zealand's hands by England in the greatest final of all 
            time.</p>
